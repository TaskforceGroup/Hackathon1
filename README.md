# Hackathon1
Code for the first hackathon

## About
This database/interface will be called pandoras_box. Named by the all powerful and benevolent Crimson Sky

We are using Flask because it is very customizable and runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows. It's also minimal so we should be able to build this in any direction we would want to go. It's likely that the frontend will be in HTML/CSS/JS and this would enable this to run from a single workstation or a server.

See this tutorial on how to add more functionality to this program https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database (Flask documentation can be sometimes hard to find so we should use the resource above to have a standard programming structure)

How to run:
Create a venv: python -m venv venv

Activate the venv: source venv/bin/activate

Install packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the local server (Linux and MacOS): ./dev.sh
